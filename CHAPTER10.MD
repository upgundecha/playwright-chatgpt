# Chapter 10 - Design Patterns

## Playwright Design Patterns

Playwright supports several common design patterns that can be used when writing tests. These patterns include the page object pattern, the page fragment pattern, the data-driven testing pattern, and the behavior-driven development (BDD) pattern.

The page object pattern is a design pattern that separates the page-specific logic and elements from the tests, and provides a high-level API for interacting with the page. This allows the tests to be written in a more readable and maintainable way, and makes it easier to update the tests when the page changes.

The page fragment pattern is a design pattern that breaks down a page into smaller, reusable fragments, such as a header or footer. This allows the tests to focus on specific parts of the page, and makes it easier to reuse the fragments in multiple tests.

The data-driven testing pattern is a design pattern that allows the tests to be parameterized, so that the same test can be run multiple times with different input data. This allows the tests to be more comprehensive and cover a wider range of scenarios.

The behavior-driven development (BDD) pattern is a design pattern that focuses on the behavior of the system being tested, rather than the implementation details. This allows the tests to be written in a more natural and human-readable language, and makes it easier for stakeholders to understand and collaborate on the tests.

## The Page Object Design Pattern

The page object pattern is a design pattern that separates the page-specific logic and elements from the tests, and provides a high-level API for interacting with the page. This allows the tests to be written in a more readable and maintainable way, and makes it easier to update the tests when the page changes.

Here is an example of how to use the page object pattern in Playwright:

```javascript
// Define a page object class for the login page
class LoginPage {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page
  }

  // Define a method that fills in the username and password fields and clicks the login button
  async login(username, password) {
    // Fill in the username field
    await this.page.fill('#username', username)

    // Fill in the password field
    await this.page.fill('#password', password)

    // Click the login button
    await this.page.click('#login')
  }
}

// Define a test that uses the page object
describe('my tests', () => {
  it('should be able to login', async () => {
    // Launch a browser instance
    const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()

    // Create a new context (i.e. a new incognito window)
    const context = await browser.newContext()

    // Create a new page
    const page = await context.newPage()

    // Navigate to the login page
    await page.goto('https://www.example.com/login')

    // Create an instance of the LoginPage class
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page)

    // Use the login method of the LoginPage class to log in
    await loginPage.login('username', 'password')

    // Close the browser instance
    await browser.close()
  })
})
```

In this example, we define a `LoginPage` class that provides a `login` method for logging in to the page. We then use the `LoginPage` class in the test, creating an instance of the `LoginPage` class and calling the `login` method to log in. This allows us to separate the page-specific logic and elements from the tests, making the tests more readable and maintainable.
