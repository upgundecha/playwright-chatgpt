# Chapter 8 - Running tests in CI

To run Playwright tests in a continuous integration (CI) environment, you can use a tool like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the process of running your tests and publishing the results.

For example, using GitHub Actions, you can define a workflow in your repository that specifies the steps to run your tests, such as installing dependencies, building your code, and running your tests. You can then trigger the workflow automatically when new code is pushed to your repository, or on a schedule, and view the results in the Actions tab of your repository.

Here is an example workflow that uses GitHub Actions to run Playwright tests:

```yaml
name: Playwright tests

on: [push, schedule]

jobs:
  playwright:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build code
        run: npm run build
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
In this example, the workflow is triggered automatically when new code is pushed to the repository, or on a schedule. The workflow consists of four steps:

1. The `actions/checkout` action is used to clone the repository and checkout the code.
2. The `npm install` command is run to install the dependencies of the project.
3. The `npm run build` command is run to build the code.
4. The `npm test` command is run to run the tests.

Once the workflow is completed, the results of the tests will be published to the Actions tab of the repository, where you can view the details of each run and see whether the tests passed or failed.

Overall, using GitHub Actions or another CI tool, you can automate the process of running Playwright tests in your project and ensure that your code is tested and working properly.


Here are some recommendations for running Playwright tests in a continuous integration (CI) environment:

- Use a dedicated testing environment: In a CI environment, it's important to ensure that your tests are running in a clean and consistent environment. To do this, you can use a dedicated testing environment, such as a virtual machine or cloud instance, to run your tests. This will help ensure that your tests are not affected by any conflicting dependencies or other factors on the host system.
- Use a headless browser: To run Playwright tests in a CI environment, it's recommended to use a headless browser, which is a browser that runs without a user interface. This allows your tests to run quickly and efficiently, without the overhead of rendering a full browser window. Playwright supports running tests in headless mode for all major browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- Use parallel testing: To speed up the execution of your tests, you can use parallel testing, which allows you to run multiple tests at the same time on different machines or processes. Playwright supports running tests in parallel, and you can use tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to distribute your tests across multiple machines or processes.
- Use test retries: To improve the reliability of your tests, you can use test retries, which allows you to automatically retry failed tests to see if they pass on a subsequent attempt. Playwright supports retrying tests, and you can use tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to configure the number of retries and other settings.
- Monitor test results: To track the results of your tests and ensure that they are running correctly, you can use a test reporting tool to monitor the results of your tests and notify you of any failures or other issues. Playwright can generate test reports in various formats, such as JUnit or XUnit, and you can use tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to publish and view the reports.

Overall, by following these recommendations, you can improve the reliability and efficiency of your Playwright tests in a CI environment, and ensure that your code is properly tested and working as expected.
